#Write a program that computes the average of a series of numbers entered by the user. To make the program more user-friendly, store all the numbers in a list so that the user's numbers can be displayed before the average appears. Have your program stop accepting values when the user enters the value -999. Note that this value, -999, should not be averaged in with the other numbers.
number_list = []
sum = 0.0

user_number = eval(input("Please enter a number (-999 quits): "))

# Loop until the user is ready to quit
while (user_number != -999):
    number_list.append(user_number)
    sum = sum + user_number
    user_number = eval(input("Please enter a number (-999 quits): "))

# Make sure the user entered something
if (len(number_list) != 0):
    # Compute average
    average = sum / len(number_list)

    # Do output
    print ("Using the numbers:")

    for i in range(len(number_list)):
        # Note the end = " " at the end will keep the output on
        #   the same line
        print (number_list[i], end = " ")

    # Note the \n at the start of this line is needed because
    #   the previous print statement ended with a comma.  This
    #   \n will move the cursor to the next line
    print ("\nThe average is:", average)
else:
    print ("No values were entered")
